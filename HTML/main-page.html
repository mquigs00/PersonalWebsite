    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <h3>
      Intelligent Automation Intern, JG Wentworth Financial Company
      (May-October, 2021)
    </h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automated the influx of client data by coding bots to retrieve Excel files from emails sent by client creditors, and loading the data to SQL tables</li>
        <li>Responsible for programming a bot to process dozens of Excel files for the accounting team, reducing time spent from 8+ hours to less than 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Saved the company $100,000+ by programming a bot to manually extract thousands of emails from a former company email server </li>
        <li>Documented past and future projects for the team and mentored incoming intern</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Research Experience</h2>
    <p>
      In the spring of 2020, I performed an independent study in machine
      learning under Dr. William Mongan at Ursinus. We worked with PhD students
      at Drexel University to develop an algorithm that would dynamically select
      between different antennas based on previous signal strength, while still
      including an element of randomness to avoid neglecting antennas that may
      gain stronger signals over time.

      I had the pleasure of hiring and managing Matthew during his internship
      with JG Wentworth. Matt was able to quickly onboard and start delivering
      value. Matt knows how to find his own solutions or ask for help when he
      gets stuck. About a month in, I was able to trust Matt to drive projects
      on his own. He possess good intuition that enables him to provide the best
      solution to balance complexity and delivery speed. This is fundamentally
      driven thanks to his intellectual curiosity to understand the business
      impact of his work. The highlight of the internship was when Matt
      developed a custom AI component to solve a data mapping problem we were
      struggling with for some time. He implemented Levenshtein distance to
      allow for intelligent field mapping at runtime which was crucial for
      deployment. To give Matt additional exposure, I provided him with
      opportunities to write business requirements and write crucial RPA legacy
      API integrations. He was successful with both tasks, needing minimal
      guidance. Given his stellar performance, I opted to allow Matt to stay on
      part-time with us in conjunction with his fall classes. His drive combined
      with the ability to think outside of the box and seamlessly apply
      classroom knowledge makes Matt a great addition to any team!
